# Cleanup
Tiny Bash script clean up certain files from my ~/tmp and ~/Download folders

I accumulate alot of download files from grading students assignments. This script cleans up my ~/tmp and ~/Downloads folders of these files.

Declares an array variable of document types. Then a for loop array to remove the files from the indicated folders.
